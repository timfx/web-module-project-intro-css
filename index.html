      <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the <br>
        power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
      <br>
      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but <br>
        within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient <br>
        giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

        <p>Fire is a natural and essential <br>
          part of Yosemite. We manage fire <br>
           carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s<br>
            ecosystems. This blog provides<br>
             updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span class ="important_info">current fire<br>

        <p>We strongly recommend that you make <br>
           reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the<br>

             (there's no need to pay it in<br>
